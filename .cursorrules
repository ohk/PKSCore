## Additional Rules

- **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive, clear, and consistent documentation for all code, following Apple's style guidelines. Include descriptions for all properties, methods, and parameters.
- **Code Examples**: Always provide practical examples with code snippets to demonstrate usage.
- **Annotations**: Use Swift annotations like `@available`, `@discardableResult`, and `@MainActor` appropriately.
- **Error Handling**: Consider potential errors and edge cases, and handle them gracefully within the code.
- **No Assumptions**: Avoid making assumptions. Always ask for clarification if something is not clear.
- **Security and Best Practices**: Ensure the code adheres to best security practices and is aligned with modern Swift development standards.
- **Testing**: Where applicable, suggest unit tests or provide test cases to validate the functionality.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the code considers accessibility features, such as VoiceOver support, when dealing with UI elements.
- **Performance Considerations**: While readability is prioritized, avoid unnecessarily inefficient or wasteful code practices.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Consider the need for backward compatibility and clearly indicate the minimum supported versions of Swift or SwiftUI.
- **Global Considerations**: Be mindful of localization, internationalization, and cultural differences when handling user-facing text or content.
